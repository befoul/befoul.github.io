    <h2>What certs make you noticable in the industry?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <p>There are a couple of certifications that recruiters and hiring managers look at when deciding the best fit for their needs, a couple of which mean more than others, and in this post I will be discussing them.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>For starters, it depends on what job you are looking for and how experienced you believe yourself to be, as in are you knowledgeable in network security architecture? Then take your NetSec+ from CompTIA, or are you more confident in your ability to red team? Then take the eJPT from INE Security.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The certification roadmap all depends on your current ability to perform whatever it is you decide you want to take a cert for; figuring out where to start on them is the bigger question, though.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In my experience and in many others, a good foundation to get a respectable and scalable job is to get the NetSec+ (Sec+) from CompTIA. This certification gives recruiters for entry-level and intermediate-level jobs confidence in your candidacy. This certification takes the in-and-out knowledge of different network security approaches and optimization methods; being able to set up a fast, reliable, and secure network for an enterprise is truly what this cert demonstrates while also being known as kind of a novice.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>While certifications like the A+ and Net+ from CompTIA are "good" foundational certifications, they still broadcast that you are still green in this field and have not had too much experience if those are the ones at the top of your cert list, making them, in my opinion, not necessary in an industry job search.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <h2>Where can I research my own cert roadmap?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are many sites and posts about certification roadmaps, but I would only look at a few.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <p><a href="https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/">Pauljerimy roadmap</a></p> 
    <p><a href="https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/it-certification-roadmap-8-5x11-online363c382c09d76fc19da8ff0a002c2329">CompTIA roadmap</a></p> 
    <p><a href="https://www.totalsem.com/blog/it-career-path-certification-path-map/">Total Seminar roadmap</a></p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <p>Regardless of your level of knowledge or experience, these roadmaps can help you find and track down which direction you should be headed for next in your journey.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <p>Good luck on your next endevour!</p>
